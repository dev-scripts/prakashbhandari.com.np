In early days of my career I use to struggle to build the resume. 
Many times I used Microsoft Word Template. I also tried to create resume by using online websites. 
None of the online website were free and had some kinds of limitations like adding watermarks or asking to pay while exporting the resume.
I was looking for a free online resume builder which can help millions of job seekers to build proper 
resume without any struggle or without needing help from experts.

Finally, I found [Reactive Resume Builder](https://rxresu.me/), which is free resume builder without any hidden limitations. 
You can build the resume and publicly share to any other people.  App is available with highly customizable feature.
I could not imagine even we can get this kind of app for free.
