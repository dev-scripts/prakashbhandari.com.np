In early days of my career I used to struggle to build the resume. I had no idea how to build the proper resume.
Most of the time I used Microsoft Word Template to create proper resume. Also, tried online website apps to generate resume. 
None of the online websites were free and those online apps had some kinds of limitations like adding watermarks or asking to pay while exporting the resume.

I was looking for a free online resume builder which can help me as well as millions of job seekers who is willing to build 
their resume from anywhere and anytime without struggle or needing help from experts.

Finally, I found [Reactive Resume Builder](https://rxresu.me/), which is free resume builder without any hidden limitations.
With the help of this app, you can create multiple resumes, share them with recruiters or friends through a unique link and print it as a PDF, all for free, no ads,
no tracking, without losing the integrity and privacy of your data.

Also, this app is available with many customizable features. I could not even imagine we can get this kind of app for free.
