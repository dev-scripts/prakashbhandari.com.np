Dockerizing is the process of packing, deploying, and running applications using Docker containers.
Docker is very popular among the developers. In this post, I am going to show you **"Containerize Your .NET 7.0 Web Application With Docker"**.
for local development.

Before that, I will briefly explain what is docker and .NET

## What Is Docker?
**[Docker](https://www.docker.com/)** is an open source tool that combines your application with all
the necessary dependencies and libraries as one portable package (docker image).
That package can be shared to any one and run by anyone without much worrying about the operating system.

## What Is .NET?

.NET (pronounced as "dot net"; formerly named .NET Core) is a free and open-source, managed software framework for Windows, Linux, and macOS operating systems. 
It is a platform independent and successor to .NET Framework.

>Dockerizing is the process of packing, deploying, and running applications using Docker containers.

##  Prerequisites
Docker should be pre-installed in your machine.
If you don't have, please install form following link:
1. Install docker form : https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/

## Steps to Containerize .NET Web Application With Docker

.NET 7.0 Web Application can be decorize in following steps.

### Step 1 : Create New .NET 7.0 Web Application

Either your can use existing .NET 7.0 web application or create new .NET 7.0 web application.

I will be creating small .NET 7.0 web application to access the default API end point provided by the framework.

I am using visual studio to create the .NET 7.0 web application. I am assuming you know how to create the .NET we Application.


Once you create the application. By default, the app will give us a `WeatherForecastController.cs` file, which will have default API 
to list the Weather Forecast. I will be testing the Weather Forecast API after containerizing the app.

Here is the structure of my Dotnet application.

![Containerize Your .NET 7.0 web application With Docker](/images/posts/containerize-your-dotnet-web-application-with-docker/project-structure.png#center)

### Step 2 : Create `Dockerfile` file

Create a `Dockerfile` inside root of your project. 
This file should include following instruction.

```
# Stage 1: Build the application
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:7.0 AS build
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the project file and restore dependencies
COPY ["dockerizeDotNet7App.csproj", "."]
RUN dotnet restore dockerizeDotNet7App.csproj

# Copy the rest of the application code
COPY . .

# Build the application
RUN dotnet build dockerizeDotNet7App.csproj -c Release -o /app/build

# Publish the application
RUN dotnet publish dockerizeDotNet7App.csproj -c Release -o /app/publish

# Stage 2: Create the final image
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:7.0 AS final
WORKDIR /app
EXPOSE 80

# Copy the published application from the build stage
COPY --from=build /app/publish .

# Set the entry point
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "dockerizeDotNet7App.dll"]
```

### Step 3 - Add a `docker-compose.yml` file

Add a `docker-compose.yml` in your project root. Please check in the attached project structure image. This `docker-compose.yml` is not necessary, but it helps to build abd
run the docker image and container easily.

I have used following instruction in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  web_app:
    build:
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "9000:80"
```

#### Port mapping

Port mapping is very important here step. In Stage 2 of `Dockerfile`, where I have open a port on the Docker container. You might be thinking port 80 is default or common port and should be open by default, But in docker, it is not. By default, Docker doesnâ€™t allow inbound requests to your container unless you explicitly tell Docker to open a port.
In this project I am exposing port `80` internally in side Docker and mapped to port `9000` of host machine form `docker-compose.yml` file. So that I can run my application in `http://localhost:9000/`


### Step 4 - Build Docker Image
To build docker image, you have to run `docker compose build` command. This command will take few minutes to
pull the dotnet image, install dependencies, copy files, and create app image. May be you can skip this step and directly
jump tp step 5

### Step 5 - Start the containers
Now, you can run `docker compose up` command. This command will start project in the container and
maps container's internal port `80` to external port `9000`.

Once `docker compose up` is successful, you can access your app locally via web browser `http://localhost:9000/WeatherForecast`
Here, `WeatherForecast` is the default API provided by .NET 7.0.

To stop the containers, press Ctrl+C in the terminal.

Here is the output log for docker compose up

### Step 6 - Test The Application

You should be able to access your application locally at port number `9000`.
Y
ou can browse `http://localhost:9000/WeatherForecast` in your web browser, and you should be able to see below screen.

## Conclusion

Finally, we are done. That's it!

We have locally created .NET 7.0 Web Application, containerize the app using docker and ran with the help of docker-compose tool.
Hope this steps helped you
to skill up.
